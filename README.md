# Generics
> Higher level serialization of rust values to rust values, and from rust values.

Reusable stuff for mapping values to and from an intermediate serde-like data
format. That is actually something you can pattern match on.

For use cases that work with native values directly, and donâ€™t involve parsing
from some textual or binary format.

Should be useful for people writing higher level abstractions upon e.g. some
DynamoDB SDK that handles HTTP/JSON serialization internally. Yet still
exposes a very tedious data format/api.


# Status

Currently just `IntoGeneric` is implemented. Eventually I would like to support
both `IntoGeneric` and perhaps some `FromGeneric` trait and deriving macro.
